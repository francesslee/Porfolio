			<p>Mega is a mobile app that allows you to broadcast live sound from your phone across multiple smartphone speakers within a physical range. As a host, your voice is transmitted through your smartphone’s microphone to a server, and attendees stream your voice via Wifi or data.</p>

			<h2>User Surveys and User Personas</h2>
			<p>In my exploratory survey, I asked users about audio streaming habits, satisfaction with their smartphone speakers, and if they would stream audio from multiple devices. The results showed that most people who listen to audio on their phones are streaming audio from music services (like Spotify, Pandora) or playing videos from Youtube. Some people complained about the poor audio quality on their phones, and the short battery life of external bluetooth speakers. Nearly all users agreed that the convenience of their phone speakers for playing audio completely outweighed any shortcomings.</p>
			<p>In analyzing the survey results, I saw that the music streaming space is well accounted for with excellent subscription based apps and a booming market of portable bluetooth speakers. I decided to shift the focus of my app to serve leaders who need to speak to large groups in informal settings. </p>
			<p>I created four separate user personas: Rally Organizer, Tour Guide, Yoga Instructor, Classroom Educator.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<p>For the Mega logo, I reached back in history and pulled out a vintage cheerleader’s bullhorn. I liked its balance of lines and curves, and relied on a circular theme when creating the app’s other elements. I wanted the app to convey a feeling of dependability and accessibility. As Mega is a relatively uncomplicated app, I used color and layout to focus the user on essential elements.</p>

			<h2>Wireframes and User Flows</h2>
			<p>Mega is a lightweight app with a few, very critical user flows: Create a stream, start broadcasting, and find and play a stream. I choose to not require account creation, as that is a barrier to use. On the stream page, I included options to record, share, and edit a stream (Host only). I also displayed a countdown to a broadcast, which changes to a timer after it begins. Broadcasting and streaming start and stop at the tap of a single prominent button. </p>

			<h2>User Testing</h2>
			<p>I used Lookback to record users testing my first Mega prototype. As I observed users getting stuck on the stream page, it became clear to me that I did not display enough navigation for returning to the main page. I restructured the app in three horizontal sections: Search on the left, Stream list in the middle, Individual stream page on the right. I used 3 navigation icons to represent each page. Users simply swipe towards the icon for the page they wish to access.</p>
			<img class="screen" src="images/megausertesting.png" alt="Mega Search, Main, and Stream pages">
			<p class="alltext">Originally, I had used a speaker icon to indicate play, and the square icon to indicate stop. Users did not all agree on what icons that indicated play or stop, which led me to more research on audio interfaces. I learned that those icons are used in slightly different contexts. Users might think they are turning on their sound stopping the broadcast, when neither of those cases is true. I replaced those icons with a triangle for play, and two bars for pause. Granted, when an attendee presses the pause button, they are not truly pausing the broadcast, as it is live. But the familiar meaning of the pause icon best serves the button’s function.</p>

			<h2>Final Prototype</h2>
			<p>While designing the hi-fi mocks, I chose green for streaming screens, and pink for broadcast screens, as a nod to the traditionally red record button. When a stream starts, the thin line in the middle of the screen expands to a wavy animation to indicate volume levels of the host’s voice.</p>
			<p>On the main streams page, I opted for a timeline view of upcoming streams, with the most recent stream emphasized at the top of the timeline, and the ability to scroll down to see future streams. Users tap on the stream area to visit the stream page, and can immediately start streaming if the broadcast has started.</p>
			<p>I was under the assumption that the first design of my stream page was uncluttered, due to its limited range of actions. However, there was even more I could do to simplify the page, especially for a host who needs to quickly understand the interface. I conducted research on one-button alarm clocks and how to work within the restrictions of a minimal interface. I centered the circular play/pause button on the bottom half of the screen, and relegated all other secondary actions to the top of the screen, giving them a distinct smaller oval shape.</p>
